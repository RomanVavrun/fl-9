    Task #2. Guessing game
    Your task is to write a game. 
    
    Requirements:
    Step 1:
    	Create a prompt window (use confirm()). Show the message inside the window ‘Do you want to play a game?’
    	In case the user clicks the 'Cancel' button, the message 'You did not become a millionaire, but can.' should be shown (use alert).
    Step 2:
    	If user clicked ‘Ok’ – start a game: randomly (use Math.random()) choose a number in range [0; 5], and ask user to enter a number. (use prompt())
    	User has 3 attempts to guess a number
    	If user guessed number on 1-st attempt prize is 10$ (maximum prize for current numbers range), 2-nd attempt – 5$, 3-rd attempt – 2$. 
    	If user did not guess a number show the message ‘Thank you for a game. Your prize is: …’ (Use alert), and ask if he wants to play again (use confirm).
    Step 3:
    	If user did guess - Show the message ‘Congratulation!   Your prize is: … Do you want to continue?’
    	If user does not want to continue – show the message ‘Thank you for a game. Your prize is: …’ (Use alert), and ask if he wants to play again (use confirm).
    	If user does want to continue, make number range twice as big as the previous one /* for example [0; 5] -> [0; 10] */, and three times bigger maximum prize /* for example on 1-st attempt prize will be 30$, 2-nd attempt – 15$, 3-rd attempt – 7$ */. Prize must be added to the previous one and number of attempts should be set to 3 (user should have 3 attempts to guess a number for each numbers range)
    	Each time you ask user to enter a number you should show him a range of numbers, how much attempts he has left, his total prize and possible prize on current attempt.
